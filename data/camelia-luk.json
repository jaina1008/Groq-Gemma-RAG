In that period I have worked on back and front end, was in charge of dev and developmental tasks, developed micro service and monolith architectures. I say I am an expert in those, as I still learn new things every day, but I think I have a decent overall knowledge of how things work, how they should work, and why they. I believe in balance of new technologies and good old principles.",
